          Sareedo Community Development Organization (SCDO) is an independent, nonprofit, and non-governmental organization dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable communities across Somalia. We provide expert project management, research, and development solutions in key focus areas such as livelihoods, economic inclusion, climate change, social development, protection, and good governance.
          Founded by a team of multi-disciplinary Somali experts, SCDO delivers insightful and objective analysis on a wide range of social issues including conflict dynamics, peacebuilding, drought response, and resilience strategiesâ€”particularly for youth, women, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and impoverished rural communities.
